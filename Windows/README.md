# Introduction

[NOTE]: Windows SDK is still in beta release.

Windows SDK is aming for applications running on .net platform. You need to add both IRNet.dll and IRNetCore.dll in your project references. The IRNet has dependency on Newtonsoft.Json so  the Newtonsoft.Json should also be added in the project references.

Alternatively, you can add the up-to-date IRNet files by using NuGet. Simply search Bomeans.IRNet in your NuGet manager if you are using Visual Studio.
